# This project is a Dungeons and Dragons combat tracker that keeps track of health, initiative, and status (alive/unconcious/dead) of the players and the enemies. Dungeons and Dragons is a table top rpg game that has one dungeon master who manages a world he creates with his own imagination, and a couple of players who make characters and explore the world. The problem is that the Dungeon Master has to manage a lot about this world, and it can often be overwelhming. So, I designed a program that automates one of the hardest things to keep track of: combat. Combat in D and D usually starts with an initiative roll, which determines the order in which the players and the enemies take their turns. The players and enemies take their turns to either attack eachother, heal their allies, or do something else. So, the primary feature of this program is to keep track of initiative. As a secondary feature, the program asks the player or the enemy what they would like to do on each of their turns, and keeps track of the amount of damage they do to their opponents and the amount of healing they do to their allies. Lastly, if a player reaches 0 health, the program prompts them to roll "death saves", in which players roll dice to see whether their character becomes stable or dies. 
# I submitted this project as my final project for cs50 (an online course at Harvard) in the summer of 2020, and it allowed me to show off all the skills I learned from this course
